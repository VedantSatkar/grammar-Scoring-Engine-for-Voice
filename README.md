# 🗣️ Grammar Scoring Engine for Voice

This project is a **Grammar Scoring Engine** that takes **spoken input from the user**, converts it to text, and evaluates the grammar of that text using NLP techniques. It's especially helpful for students, language learners, and developers building educational or voice-enabled AI tools.

## 📌 Features

- 🎤 **Voice Input Support** – Speak through a mic to interact with the app.
- 🧠 **Grammar Evaluation** – Analyzes your spoken sentence for grammatical accuracy.
- 📊 **Grammar Score** – Calculates and displays a score based on grammar quality.
- 📝 **Feedback System** – Shows corrected versions or suggestions.
- ⚙️ **Simple UI** – Can be run via terminal or with a GUI (Tkinter/Streamlit).

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Python**
- **SpeechRecognition**
- **PyAudio**
- **language-tool-python**
- **NLTK / spaCy**
- (Optional) **Tkinter / Streamlit** for GUI

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user speaks into the microphone.
2. The application converts speech to text using `SpeechRecognition`.
3. The text is sent to `LanguageTool` or `spaCy` for grammar checking.
4. A grammar accuracy score is calculated.
5. Suggestions or corrected text are shown to the user.

venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


📦 3. Install All Required Dependencies
If a requirements.txt is provided:

pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyaudio
pip install language-tool-python
pip install nltk

🎯 4. Run the Application
Assuming your main script is named app.py, run:

python app.py


###🎤5. Use the Application
Speak clearly into your microphone when prompted.
