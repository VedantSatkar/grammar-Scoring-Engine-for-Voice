# üó£Ô∏è Grammar Scoring Engine for Voice

This project is a **Grammar Scoring Engine** that takes **spoken input from the user**, converts it to text, and evaluates the grammar of that text using NLP techniques. It's especially helpful for students, language learners, and developers building educational or voice-enabled AI tools.

---

## üìå Features

- üé§ **Voice Input Support** ‚Äì Speak through a mic to interact with the app.
- üß† **Grammar Evaluation** ‚Äì Analyzes your spoken sentence for grammatical accuracy.
- üìä **Grammar Score** ‚Äì Calculates and displays a score based on grammar quality.
- üìù **Feedback System** ‚Äì Shows corrected versions or suggestions.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Simple UI** ‚Äì Can be run via terminal or with a GUI (Tkinter/Streamlit).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- **Python**
- **SpeechRecognition**
- **PyAudio**
- **language-tool-python**
- **NLTK / spaCy**
- (Optional) **Tkinter / Streamlit** for GUI

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1. The user speaks into the microphone.
2. The application converts speech to text using `SpeechRecognition`.
3. The text is sent to `LanguageTool` or `spaCy` for grammar checking.
4. A grammar accuracy score is calculated.
5. Suggestions or corrected text are shown to the user.

## ‚úÖ Getting Started ‚Äì Step by Step Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally on your machine:

---

### üì• 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VedantSatkar/grammar-Scoring-Engine-for-Voice.git
cd grammar-Scoring-Engine-for-Voice
```

---

### üß™ 2. (Optional) Create and Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### üì¶ 3. Install All Required Dependencies

If a `requirements.txt` is provided:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyaudio
pip install language-tool-python
pip install nltk
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note for PyAudio**:
If you face installation issues, run:
```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

---

### üéØ 4. Run the Application

Assuming your main script is named `app.py`, run:

```bash
python app.py
```

---

### üé§ 5. Use the Application

- Speak clearly into your microphone when prompted.
- Wait while your speech is transcribed and analyzed.
- View your **grammar score** and **suggested corrections** on the screen or terminal.
